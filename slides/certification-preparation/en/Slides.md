name: passed
class: h1-fullwidth
layout: false

# Exam passed

* Before using any certification logo or calling yourself a «TYPO3 CMS Certified Integrator», you will be required to pass the certification examination offered by the TYPO3 Association, and you must receive notice from the TYPO3 Association stating that:
    * you may use that particular certification banner and
    * you are allowed to call yourself «TYPO3 CMS Certified Integrator».
---
name: logo
class: h1-fullwidth
layout: false

# Certified Integrator logo

* If you are a freelancer or a one-person-company, you may integrate the logo in a global scope being generally visible (e.g: your website's footer or sidebar).

--

* If you are working for a company that has more than one employee, the logo must only be used where it is directly associated with the certified employees.
<br>For example: You may not use the logo on the homepage, or in the site footer, but you may use it on the employees bio or team-member page of the site should one exist.
---
name: difficulty
class: h1-fullwidth
layout: false

# How difficulty and cutscores for the exam are determined?

<br>
* The questions are coming randomly from a question pool.

--

* So you get a mixture of simple and difficult questions.

--

* The cutting score is 51. So you need at least 51 correct answered questions out of 75.
---
name: faq
class: h1-fullwidth
layout: false

# Scoring FAQ

* Do you inform me about the score I have reached in the exam?
<br>Yes

???
You get the score via email. It is not visible on the certificate.

--

* Am I granted access to the records?
<br>No, we cannot allow you to examine the files.

???
  First of all examining the exam will not help you in any way since we will not give you any information regarding which questions have been answered correctly or incorrectly.
  The administrative overhead would be far too large and we do not want to raise the price for the certification just because of a few curious people.
  In case of doubt we cross check the exams so the source of errors should be as low as ever possible.

---
name: objectives
class: h1-fullwidth
layout: false

# Objectives - Subject areas

* If not stated otherwise questions as of now refer to TYPO3 CMS version 10 LTS

--

* There are 10 Objectives (subject areas)
<br>These can change at anytime and/or an exam can contain less oder more questions from one objective

--

* It is important to know the differences between other TYPO3 versions, so get familiar with the „What’s new in TYPO3“ documents as well:
<br>[http://typo3.org/download/release-notes/whats-new/](http://typo3.org/download/release-notes/whats-new/)
---
name: notneed
class: h1-fullwidth
layout: false

# Objectives - What is NOT needed?

* Take a look at the registration page which TYPO3 version is used for the exam!
* Part of the exam are just system extensions (which are part of the release) but no other extension from the TER (TYPO3 Extension Repository)
<br>So, no mask, news, powermail, …
* Relevant are just these system extensions, which belong to the definition of an Integrator, so - no Extbase but Fluid!

# PSR-2 - Coding Style Guide

It considers PSR-1 and it is intended to reduce cognitive friction when scanning code from different authors. It does so by enumerating a shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code.

# PSR-4 - Autoloading Standard

It describes a specification for autoloading classes from file paths. It is fully interoperable, and can be used in addition to any other autoloading specification, including PSR-0. This PSR also describes where to place files that will be auto loaded according to the specification.

The PSR-7 request objects created by TYPO3 now contain an instance of NormalizedParams which can be used instead of `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()` to access normalized server params.

```php
/** @var NormalizedParams $normalizedParams */
$normalizedParams = $request->getAttribute('normalizedParams');
$requestPort = $normalizedParams->getRequestPort();
```
